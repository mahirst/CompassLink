CompassLink transforms concern into peace of mind, linking families with unhoused loved ones via a PIN system for location updates and meal coupons. A $10/mo beacon of hope for connection and support.

## Abstract
Imagine a world where we can bridge the gap between concern and care for our unhoused loved ones, particularly those battling mental health and addiction issues. 'CompassLink' is an innovative app designed to transform worry into peace of mind. For a modest $10 monthly subscription, it offers a lifeline between unhoused individuals and their families. Through a simple, anonymous PIN system, loved ones can log in at any public library to send a 'ping' to their family's phone, indicating their city or state location and assuring them they're alive. This action also rewards them with a daily meal coupon from participating restaurants, providing a tangible incentive to engage with the app. 'CompassLink' isn't just an app; it's a beacon of hope, offering a unique solution to a complex problem by making the invisible visible. It's about safety, being heard, and reconnecting families, one login at a time. Born from a personal story of concern for a missing brother, 'CompassLink' is more than technology—it's a pathway to understanding, support, and perhaps most importantly, family peace of mind.

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind CompassLink app stems from a deep concern for unhoused individuals, particularly those facing mental health and addiction challenges. The goal is to bridge the gap between concern and care for these individuals. CompassLink envisions an innovative solution to transform this concern into peace of mind for families by creating a secure and anonymous communication system. The app is driven by empathy, offering a lifeline of connection and support while respecting privacy and promoting understanding. It was born from a personal story of concern for a missing brother, making it more than just technology; it's a pathway to family peace of mind.

## What it does
Families subscribe to the app, and both they and the unhoused individuals receive unique PINs. Unhoused individuals can log in at public libraries, sending location notifications to their families, indicating their city or state. As an incentive, unhoused individuals receive daily meal coupons from participating restaurants.

## How we built it
The idea for CompassLink was born out of a personal experience, driven by a deep concern for a missing family member who is unhoused and battling severe mental health issues. Recognizing the need to bridge the gap between concern and care for unhoused individuals, we envisioned an innovative solution. To build CompassLink as an actual app, we would begin by conducting extensive research on homelessness and the unique challenges faced by this vulnerable population. We would collaborate with experts in the field, including social workers and advocates, to ensure that the app would address real-world needs and concerns. The development process would involve designing a user-friendly interface with a focus on privacy and security. We would implement a $10/mo subscription model to fund the app's operations and the meal coupon program. The core functionality would rely on a simple yet effective PIN system, allowing unhoused individuals to log in at public libraries, sending location notifications to their families while preserving their anonymity. In parallel, partnerships would be established with participating restaurants to provide daily meal coupons, creating a powerful incentive for unhoused individuals to engage with the app. CompassLink is not just a technological solution; it's a testament to empathy and understanding. It offers a lifeline of connection, support, and hope for families while respecting the dignity and privacy of unhoused individuals. It's an app built on compassion, designed to make a tangible difference in the lives of those facing homelessness and mental health challenges.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Limited time resources
2. Too many ideas and ways to implement this project- needed to prioritize working on the highlights of CompassLink
3. Working through sensitive topics that concern unhoused individuals
4. Thinking about how to make an app accessible enough to be used by a group of people in which many of them do not have access to technology, internet connection or how to use these things 
5. Brainstorming solutions to:
-where, when and how unhoused people would have access to our app 
-how to make our app as user-friendly as possible as it´s going to be used by people from all sort of backgrounds and limitations 
-ensure data privacy and ethical considerations when making this project
-make sure it is anonymous
-user data is secured 
-unhoused individuals will not be harmed in any way by sharing information in our app

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our main accomplishment is the potential positive impact the app can have on unhoused individuals by reconnecting them with their families and providing a tool that addresses challenges and issues that they face in their daily lives, as well as the possibility to use the data generated through to app to tackle causes and solutions for generating infrastructure to help unhoused individuals. We made sure our app is intuitive and user-friendly to attend the diverse background of unhoused individuals to promote their inclusivity, respect, and dignity.

## What we learned
We learned the importance of prioritizing user-friendly design in the creation of projects that involve vulnerable groups in our society. Taking their needs and limitations into consideration makes a huge difference on how many people will be able to use our app and be positively impacted by it. It also reinforced for us the idea of technology as a tool for social good, especially if used with empathy to reach the human stories behind the screen. We came to understanding that the world is in need of more tech solutions that take the vulnerable parts of our society as a user of the technology and not just as individuals that will receive the product of these technologies, highlighting the importance of inclusive interfaces. We also learned the value of teamwork and consistent consideration, and we made good friends along the way!

## What's next for CompassLink: Uniting families with unhoused loved ones
1. Form partnerships and collaborations to get the app up and running!
2. Start a pilot program to test the app's functionality and effectiveness.
3. Develop marketing strategies and outreach events to reach potential subscribers and participating entities such as libraries and restaurants.
4. Implementing feedback loops to collect feedback from both subscribers and participating entities to continually improve the service.
5. Continually analyze impact data to assess the app's impact on helping families stay informed about their unhoused relatives and on providing meals to unhoused individuals.
